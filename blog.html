          of students are pursuing it as their professional degree and every

          into this industry and find a good job all you need is some skill in
          what you do. Now, this market also has some special requirements that
          if you fulfill, you can get a handsome salary. Apart from all the
          other great positions, there are two very bright future careers in the
          IT industry and those are Java and software testing.
        </p>
        <h1>Java</h1>
        <p>
          If you are a programmer, you would know what Java is. It is an
          object-oriented, class-based programming language which has been
          designed to have a few implementations depended as possible. It is one
          of the most growing programming languages and is being used in
          millions of applications.
        </p>
        <h1>Why do you need to learn Java?</h1>
        <p>
          As stated by Oracle, Java is being used on more 3 billion devices.
          Java is the core component for all the Android applications that are
          available. In the first quarter of 2019, there have been 2.1 million
          Android apps, which clearly tells us that Java is the most important
          language to learn if you want to make a career in the IT industry. All
          the software houses and almost all the IT jobs require the candidate
          to have knowledge about Java. If you are keen to learn Java is not a
          very difficult language. If your object-oriented programming concepts
          are clear, then Java would just be an addition to your original
          concepts.
        </p>
        <h1>What is software testing?</h1>
        <p>
          Another very bright path in the IT industry to make a career in is
          software testing. Many people start as software testers and then enter
          in the software development section. Software testing is used to find
          out whether the application met all the specified requirements and if
          there are any bugs or errors in the software. It is a qualitative
          analysis of software and ends with a report about the performance of
          the software. It, of course, includes the information that if the product
          was good to use. As a software tester, you will make a part of the
          quality assurance stage of the software. Here you will run the
          software and conduct manual and automated results on the software to
          ensure that all the components are designed perfectly and that the
          product is ready to be sent for public use.
        </p>
        <h1>How software testing is important in the IT industry?</h1>
        <p>
          There are millions of software and applications being made every day.
          The programmer can code the whole application, but do not find the
          time to test the product. Therefore, a software tester is required to
          test every product before it goes out so that none of the customers
          receive faulty software which would affect the reputation of the
          company. Therefore, every company horse a software tester to test
          every product before it is launched. It is also a very good career
          choice. Companies pay well to the software testers, you can also earn
          through freelancing.
        </p>
        <h1>How to get into the IT industry as a fresher?</h1>
        <p>
          Well, to be honest, initially, you will face a lot of difficulties
          because everyone wants to work with a more experienced person who has
          some good projects on their profile. Therefore, for a fresher, it
          becomes difficult to convince the company that you are good enough for
          the job and would do good. However, if you want to remain in this
          industry, you will have to follow some rules. 
          <h2> 1. Be passionate about software testing. </h2>
          <p>  You can be trained to do a thing, but something that
          you are passionate about, you wouldn’t need any training. So, before
          you come into the industry prepare yourself, learn about software
          testing and make sure that you worthy enough for the job. Be passionate
          about testing, if you are not passionate you will soon start finding it
          boring and a burden. So, build your interest, and passion in it.
          If, however, you are not interested in it, learning java is always
          another option for you. </p>
          <h2> 2. Take a course </h2>
          <p> If you want to learn
          professionally you will need to take a professional course. Since this
          is not something that is taught in your college, you will have to
          learn it yourself. Java can also be learnt if you follow the right
          pages and see all the software testing tutorials. However, what you
          learn in the market and on the road, you will not learn it anywhere
          else. </p>
          <h2> 3. Practice </h2>
          <p> Practice makes a man perfect and that’s all you
          need in both Java and software testing. Practice your coding more and
          more, take a course to learn it and then come into the market fully
          prepared.
        </p>
        <h1>Is software testing very simple?</h1>
        <p>
          It may sound like software testing is very easy and it only requires
          just playing a game or running software. However, software testing is
          as tough as any other job and requires a lot of hard work. It requires
          as many technical skills as any other job. So, if you want to make a career in software
          testing, it is better that you first learn your skills and then start
          applying for jobs.
           So now you know how and why java and software
          testing are a very critical in the IT industry and every fresher must
          have an understating of both of them to successfully become a part of
          this industry.
